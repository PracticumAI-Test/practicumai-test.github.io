My background is in plant evolutionary genetics and genomics where I use genetic tools to study the conservation, evolution and diversity of plants. The field is generally computationally intensive and I have worked for 10 years training users how to use HiPerGator and other high-performance computing systems to do the amazing research that is done across th University of Florida campus.

I enjoy spending time outdoors, hiking, backpacking and kayaking.
