Unlike most faculty at UF, about half of my career has been spent in business environments, primarily Fortune 500 companies.   I am a seasoned data scientist, with more than 30 years of experience in software development, expert systems, and big data analytics.  In fact, I was first introduced to AI in 1988 while working for a friend who owned an expert systems company.  

I enjoy great art and have recently developed a fascination and love for Korean cinema and drama.
