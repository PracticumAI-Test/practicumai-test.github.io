This series of modules introduces learners to convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Check back soon for more details.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the basic operation of a convolutional neural network
1. Identify the components of a convolutional neural network and their relation to each other
1. Explain how the convolution, stride, and padding operations work
1. Use a data generator to load and transform image data sets
1. Recognize the importance of data augmentation in the training process
1. Identify when a model is overfitting or underfitting a data set
1. Be able to save and restore trained models
1. Use a pre-trained model in a different context (transfer learning)
